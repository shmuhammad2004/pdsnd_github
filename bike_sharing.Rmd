# Load Libraries

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(anytime) # for time
library(lubridate) # for time
library(janitor)  # to clean column names

```



# load the data


```{r}

new_york = read.csv("new_york_city.csv")# using base-R read.csv
washington = read.csv("washington.csv") # using tidyvers read_csv
chicago = read.csv("chicago.csv")

```


Let us observe the data:

```{r}
glimpse(new_york)
```


The variable names are not the best way of naming, let us use janitor package to clean all the column names and use camel_case style 

# clean names using janitor package


```{r}
tidy_new_york <- clean_names(new_york)
tidy_washington <- clean_names(washington)
tidy_chicago <- clean_names(chicago)

```



```{r}

glimpse(tidy_new_york)
```


# Transform the dataset

```{r}

chi_clean <- tidy_chicago %>%
  mutate(start_time = as_datetime(as.character(start_time), tz = "UTC"))  %>% # changing to time format
  mutate(end_time = as_datetime(as.character(end_time), tz = "UTC")) %>% # changing to time format
  mutate(state = 'New York') # create a new variable to compare bwteen dataset


wash_clean <- tidy_washington %>%
  mutate(start_time = as_datetime(as.character(start_time), tz = "UTC"))%>% # changing to time format
  mutate(end_time = as_datetime(as.character(end_time), tz = "UTC")) %>% # changing to time format
  mutate(state = 'Washington') # create a new variable to compare



ny_clean <- tidy_new_york %>%
  mutate(start_time = anytime(start_time)) %>% # using anytime to change to time
  mutate(end_time = anytime(end_time)) %>% # using anytime to change
  mutate(state =  'Chicago') %>%
  relocate()

```

# Combine the dataframes


```{r}
df_all_states <- bind_rows(wash_clean, chi_clean, ny_clean)

```

#  Question 1: What is the most common month?


## Vuzualization

Getting the month from the dates:

```{r}
df_all_states$month <- month(df_all_states$start_time, label = TRUE) # extracting month from the dates

```

Observing the new dataframe with the new column

```{r}
glimpse(df_all_states)
```


Plotting the month:

```{r}

df_all_states<- subset(df_all_states, !is.na(month))

ggplot(df_all_states)+
  geom_bar(aes(x= month, fill= state), position='dodge') +
  ggtitle(" Months")

```

From the plot, the most common month is June

## Summary 


```{r}
summary(df_all_states$month)

```

We can see June has the highest number of : 37147. All other months have 0 entries. We also have 


```{r}

```



# Question 2: What is the most common day of week?

## Vizualization 


```{r}
df_all_states$day_of_week <- wday(df_all_states$start_time, label = TRUE) # making a da of the week from date using wday function from lubridate

```


Plotting the graph of the date

```{r}


ggplot(df_all_states)+
  geom_bar(aes(x= day_of_week, fill= state), position='dodge') +
  ggtitle(" Days of the week")

```


From the vizualizaton above, we can see that Wedensday has the highest day of the week in Chicago and Washington. However, NeYork seems to have small number in all days. It may turns out people dont rent bike as in other cities.


## Summary 


```{r}
summary(df_all_states$day_of_week)

```

Still, `Wed` is the most common day of the week with total number of : `25092`



```{r}
summary(chi_clean$start_time)

```

# Question 3: What is the most common hour of day?


## Vuzualization


```{r}
## Create day hour field.
df_all_states$hour <-strftime(df_all_states$start_time, format="%H")

ggplot(df_all_states)+
 geom_bar(aes(x=hour, fill=state), position='dodge') +
 ggtitle("Number of rides for each hour of the day")
```


The most common hour 8AM that is when people are going  work.


 

# Summary of all the questions


```{r}
skim(df_all_states, start_time, hour, day_of_week ) %>% 

```
